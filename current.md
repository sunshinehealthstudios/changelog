v7.7.1 has been released to the App Store and Google Play Store. Within hours,
all users will be able to see and update.

v7.7.2 will address certain foods in custom recipes, favorites, and recents not
showing zero bites. If users using v7.7.1 go to track their foods, the bite
counts will be correct, and if they toggle the `0 Bite Food?`, this will also
resolve the issue. We are working on a technical fix, but it's extremely
difficult and will require a lot of work and testing to ensure we get it right.

Rest assured, nutritional information has not been lost, and this is only a zero
bite feature issue for certain existing custom recipes/favorites/recents. Any
new ones created now will not experience this same issue.
