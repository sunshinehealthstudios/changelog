v7.13 has begun 7 day rollout on iOS. Due to a few critical bugs found in Android, rollout has been paused for that platform. The team is working quickly to resolve the issues and resubmit. Hopefully this will be done by EOD Wednesday, March 16th. Apart from that, the team is also working on QA for v7.13.1 and development for v7.14.
