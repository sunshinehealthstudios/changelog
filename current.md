v7.13 has begun 7 day rollout on iOS. Due to a crashing bug found in Android, rollout has been paused for that platform. The team is working quickly to resolve the issue and resubmit. Hopefully this will be done by EOD Friday, March 11th. Apart from that, the team is also working on QA for v7.13.1 and development for v7.14.
