A 7.7.1 patch has been submitted to the app store. It will be released to 100% of users upon approval. We are now dropping everything else to address the zero bites issues seen on custom foods/recipes and favorites in a 7.7.2 patch release. 7.8 is also in QA, but may be delayed so that we can priotitize 7.7.2.
