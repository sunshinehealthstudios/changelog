We are releasing additional patch builds on iOS and Android to fix a few minor ops issues. These builds should have no impact on user's experience with the app. On iOS, v7.17.2 has passed regression and is awaiting app store review. On android, a v7.17.1 patch build is still in development. Work on v7.18 will resume once these builds are released.
