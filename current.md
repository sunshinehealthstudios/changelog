v7.19.5 has been released to 100% of users on Android. This release introduces a brand new data synchronization system that greatly improves the speed of sending and receiving data from our servers. We have also included visuals within the app to show the progress, status, and controls to restart and fix any syncing problems that may occur. The Android team is now investigating an issue with keto meal plans that will be fixed in a v7.19.6 patch. The rest of the team is working on development for v7.20.
