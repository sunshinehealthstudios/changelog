Welcome to the new iTrackBites changelog! Here you will see updates directly from me, Art Chang, the VP of Product. Our goal with the changelog is to provide a more technical glimpse into all the changes we make with every release

This isn’t the source for beautiful full feature releases, but more of a short list of what was changed without going in too deep. Think of it as bite-sized news topics on what’s new.

Get more information on new feature releases and other major updates on the [iTrackBites blog](https://itrackbites.com/blog).
