v8.6

## Overview

This version will update some of the visuals of the tracking screen to improve
readability, contrast, and overall performance. We are also making significant
updates to the app's stability.

## Details

### iOS/Android
* Updated: Refreshed the colors, contrast, and fonts on the main tracking screen
* Removed: Removed the `new` badge from the streaks feature

### iOS
* Fixed: In some cases, iOS users would lose their streaks even when only using
  one device
* Fixed: Health Checks and Weight Tracking tap areas on the tracking screen were
  too small.

### Android
* Fixed: Crash on certain devices when tapping the `+` menu
* Changed: Optimized the app size for the Android app
