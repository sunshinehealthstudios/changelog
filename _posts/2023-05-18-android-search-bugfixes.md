v8.1.1

## Overview

This patch release fixes some bugs from our last release of v8.1 on Android,
including null error when logging in, a blank space hiding the screen with some
devices with specific keyboards.

## Details

### Android
* Fixed: App crash with "add ingredients" in recipe builder

  long lists

* Fixed: Adding descriptive text to featured zero bites list to remove confusion
* Fixed: Constraint bugs on different sized screens that could cause a crash
* Fixed: Updating some of our weight loss plan colors to slight variations for
  better contrast and visibility

  white screen that seems broken

  half hidden or broken.
