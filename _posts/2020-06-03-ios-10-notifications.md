v6.8.10 - Android/iOS/Web

## Overview
We are removing iOS 10 as a supported iOS version. This is because the advanced
features we rely on are no longer able to be supported on the old iOS versions,
and the devices that cannot support more than iOS 10 are having hardware limits
that are beyond our control. Paying customers who cannot upgrade their iOS
versions should contact customer support for options.

We are also synchronizing notification settings when the app is opened. Prior to
this, we had an issue with notification settings not being recorded correctly,
but without toggling those settings, the settings were never updated. Now we
will ensure that settings are recorded properly. You may experience a change in
notifications that you're used to, so please check your settings again to
modify.

We also have a few minor bug fixes and stability improvements included that you
won't see any changes from a customer perspective.

Also, food search results have been optimized. We are using an upgraded way of
showing food items, which sould improve the experience. Food tracking will be
easier and faster.
