v6.12

## Overview
The big release for this version is the new Zero BITES search. When you want to
search specifically for Zero BITE foods, you now have a new tab in the
tracking/search screen to do so. When you open the tab up, it will show you the
most popular items searched for, and once you search, we'll only show you Zero
BITE foods.
