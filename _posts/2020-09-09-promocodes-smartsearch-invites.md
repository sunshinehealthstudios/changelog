v6.11

## Overview
This latest release includes a new feature we are releasing called Smart Search.
We will have updated blog posts and other information about it soon. New users
will be opted-in to our new food searching, and existing users will still be on
the traditional search functionality. Anyone can switch by going into your
settings. We are also adding a way to add promo codes on the web, and we have
improved inviting your friends. On top of all of that, we have a few new bug
fixes as well.
