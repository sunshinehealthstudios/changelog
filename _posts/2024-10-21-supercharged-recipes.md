v9.4 (iOS)

## Overview

We have now supercharged recipe creation, allowing recipes to be added as an ingredient, in another recipe. This allows you to combine something like your favorite sauce recipe into the main course dish recipe that you want to create.

## Details

### iOS
* Updated: Creating recipes gets an updated design, flow, and adds the ability to add other recipes as ingredients.
* Fixed: Calendars were not updating correctly, so your tracked foods may have appeared on the wrong dates.
* Fixed: Nutritional information on our Healthi recipes were showing nutritional information for total servings, now it shows per serving only.
* Updated: New design for redeeming extra allowances on BITES/calories
* Added: When users reach their water goal, a nice success animation occurs to celebrate
* Fixed: using swipe actions would block the entire UI with a success message. We have now removed that block.
* Fixed: After updating the app, Water Check and Streaks toggles are set off, they should not be set to off.
