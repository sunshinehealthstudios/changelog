## Overview
We are promoting the Fitness group on iTrackBites community, now called Fitness
Newbies. It can be found pinned to the top of the Community page. We're also
fixing a few bugs, updating some code for stability improvements, and made
changes to allow for our new Thank You Sale promotion. Lastly, new users get a
few new options to help the join relevant groups and to invite their friends in
an easier way to join them.
