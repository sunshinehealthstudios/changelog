v8.9 (iOS)

## Overview

We have updated the food detail screen designs so that the information is better
organized, easy to understand, and it is much clearer on how to change the
serving sizes. The designs also bring this screen to an update to our new
branding. In addition to this redesign, we have updated search suggestions so it
is now clearer that the suggestions are not food items.

## Details

### iOS
* New: Food detail redesign
* Fixed: Search suggestions icons changed so it is more apparent they are
  suggestions and not food items
* Fixed: Fewer suggestions that are more focused and less confusing
* Fixed: Removed the tabs for going to other search results while getting
  suggestions
* Fixed: After getting results, we don't change the results screen as much so
  it's clear that you are still in the search flow.
* Fixed: Minor upgrade screen design details
