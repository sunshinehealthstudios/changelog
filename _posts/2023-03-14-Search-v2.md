v8.0

## Overview

v8.0 includes a new and improved search experience that will make tracking faster, easier, and more enjoyable!

Here’s what’s new:

LAYOUT => We designed a larger, simpler UI to make foods, brands, bite information, and buttons easier to read and understand.

SEARCH ENGINE => Healthi's new search engine provides users with fewer, more precise results for faster tracking. This means that you might benefit from searching more specific queries. So if you are looking for cooked carrots, for example, try searching for "cooked carrots" instead of carrots only. The more specific you are, the better and more filtered results will be, saving you time and optimizing your experience.

CREATING FOODS & RECIPES => To keep our experience consistent across the board, we are revising all our icons and saving the 'plus sign' for tracking only. So you may notice that the "create food" icon is no longer a ‘plus sign ', but a 'pencil'.
