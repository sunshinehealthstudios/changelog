v8.7

## Overview

We are excited to announce our big updates to our Recipes feature for iOS, which includes a much more rich browsing experience, categories, recipe search filtering, thousands of new recipes, new images, and a redesigned look. We have also removed the current weight from the tracker screen to a more appropriate location within the profile or weight tracker.

## Details

### iOS
* New: Browsing recipes using categories, search, and filters
* New: New recipes added, more accurate and beautiful images for recipes, and a
  new design for the recipe screens.
* Fixed: Removed current tracked weight from the Tracker screen due to popular
  demand. Weight can still be found in the weight tracker and progress tab.
