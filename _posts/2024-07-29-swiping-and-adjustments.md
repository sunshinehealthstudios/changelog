v9.1 (iOS)

## Overview

We are re-introducing swiping on tracked items that reveal more actions you can
take on those individual items. This has always been available by longpressing
the items, but many users couldn't find this feature so we have added this back
using the swipe gesture. In addition, we made updates to Nutritional Information
organization, updated Create Food to allow for Quick Add functionality, and
fixed a few other minor UI issues.
