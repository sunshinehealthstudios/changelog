v7.18

## Overview
Healthi is excited to announce our new Lock Screen widget that shows your "Daily Remaining" count for the day!
- The gauge and counter will give a visual cue of the “Daily Remaining” count for the day, right on your Lock Screen
- The gauge and counter will update as you track your meals, or if you gain more from your day’s activity
- The widget itself acts as a shortcut to tracking your next meal
- You don’t need to tap into the app anymore just to get a quick glimpse at your "Daily Remaining" count

The feature requires a software update to iOS 16 (to be released Monday 9/12).
