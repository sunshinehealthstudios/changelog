v7.0

## Overview
This is a major release, bumping us up from the v6 version of iTrackBites to v7.
The big new feature here is Meal Plans! We've been working tirelessly for many
months on research, design, and development and are happy to be able to release
the first version of Meal Plans to you to ring in the new year.

This was a huge change for the product. There's a lot of work in the
infrastructure and backend to make this happen, and then all new screens and
functionality added to our applications. We've also tightened up the main home
tracker screen with better and more intuitive design, as well as adding all the
great Meal Plan features as well.

Look out for our official blog posts and more talking about Meal Plans!

## Details
### Android/iOS
* Added: Meal Plans Tab is now available in the navigation bar. You will be able
  to browse new meal plans and when you start using one, it will also be
available in this tab.
* Changed: The main tab navigation bar now has Meal Plans added, with the
  Profile tab removed and relocated to the main Tracker screen (look at the top
left of the tracker screen)
* Added: Meal Plans have daily meals that you can tap on to view all the
  details, including the recipes and food items that each meal contains. You can
then use a meal plan which will then allow you to easily track each meal as you
eat them.
* Added: Meal Plan tracking is now available on the home tracker screen. If
  you're using a Meal Plan, you can easily track each meal by tapping on the
mean from the Tracker screen.
* Added: Meal plans are now part of PRO subscription. Non-PRO users can still
  see all the details, but they cannot use the meal plan and cannot track an
entire meal. Non-PRO can still track individual food items if they go through
the Meal Plan details screens.
* Added: Meal Plans can be shared to the community, and through social. In a
  similar fashion to Recipes, users can use the share icon on the Meal Plan to
send it to others using other apps on their devices, or straight to the
iTrackBites community.
