v8.1 (iOS)

## Overview

Healthi Recipes has a whole new design! We've also included individual bite
counts and nutritional information for each ingredient by mapping all recipe
ingredients directly to our food database. Recipe ingredients used to be just
grouped together into the recipe's overall nutritional information.

We've also included a handful of new fixes as well throughout the app. Details
below.
